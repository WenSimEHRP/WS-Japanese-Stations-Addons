## Usage

To create a new station file, you can use one of the templates provided in the `templates/` directory. Simply copy the template file, rename it, and customize it according to your needs.

Please note that the generated station templates should not be modified directly. Any changes made to the templates will be overwritten the next time the generation process is run.

For more information on how to use the generated station templates, refer to the documentation or the README.md file in the root directory of this project.
